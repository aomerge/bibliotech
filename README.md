## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the microservice, refer to the following troubleshooting guide:
1. **Issue: Microservice fails to start**
   - **Solution:** 
     - Check if the necessary environment variables are correctly set.
     - Ensure the database service is running and accessible.
     - Review the logs for any error messages and address any missing dependencies.

2. **Issue: Unable to connect to the database**
   - **Solution:** 
     - Verify the database connection string in the configuration file.
     - Ensure that the database service is up and accepting connections.
     - Check firewall settings to make sure the database port is open.

3. **Issue: API request returns a 404 error**
   - **Solution:** 
     - Confirm that the endpoint URL is correct.
     - Ensure the microservice is running and properly registered in the service registry (if applicable).
     - Check if the requested resource exists in the database.

4. **Issue: High latency in API responses**
   - **Solution:** 
     - Monitor the microservice's performance to identify bottlenecks.
     - Optimize the database queries or indexing if necessary.
     - Consider scaling the microservice horizontally if under heavy load.

5. **Issue: Error 500 - Internal Server Error**
   - **Solution:** 
     - Check the server logs for stack traces or error messages.
     - Ensure all dependencies and services are correctly configured and running.
     - Review recent code changes for potential bugs or misconfigurations.
